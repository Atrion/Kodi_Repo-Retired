    <Overview>Arrow Flash is a side-scrolling space shooter. The player controls a female spaceship pilot who is sent on a mission into deep space to save the Earth from an assault by an evil dragon from another galaxy. Moving vertically or horizontally, players must avoid or kill the enemies and make it to the end of the level alive where a boss battle awaits. During gameplay, the player can switch at any time between two modes: normal spaceship and flying robot. The two forms use different weapons and also have different special abilities, called Arrow Flash. While the spaceship can fire destructive lasers for major damage, the robot can raise a shield that will protect from enemy attacks for some time and instantly kill anything that touches it. The Arrow Flash attacks can be charged by holding a button for several seconds, or collect icons during your flight to release it quickly afterwards.</Overview>

It is a console adaption of the 1993 Amiga title Brutal Football/Crazy Football (ported to the Amiga CD32 in 1994, IBM PC in 1995 and to the Atari Jagauar in 1994 as Brutal Sports Football). Beastball was also set to be released on the Super Nintendo but was presumably cancelled at the same time as this Mega Drive adaption.&#10;&#10;A prototype has since been released showing a mostly completed game. Both the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo releases were advertised in North America during late 1993, possibly asserting either a release in time for Christmas of that year, or in early 1994. The Mega Drive version was also sent out in small numbers for the press for review.&#10;&#10;Despite being built in Europe, no plans appear to have been put in place to release Beastball outside of North America.</Overview>

    <Overview>One day, four years after Jason, Eve, and Alex’s battles with the Plutonium Boss, a bolt of lightning struck Jason’s house in the land he had migrated to four years earlier and caused the ceiling to crumble, knocking him unconscious. When Jason woke up, SOPHIA 3rd NORA MA-02, which he had hidden in an abandoned barn, was in pieces and the parts he had collected four years ago from the Plutonium Boss’ mutant Underbosses were missing. Little did Jason know that there were more Lightning Beings, the kinfolk of the Plutonium Boss, and they were planning to destroy the Earth. These beings started digging towards the Earth’s core in order to shift the planet’s weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation while they sapped the underworld of plutonium. The parts from SOPHIA 3rd were being used to create a template for the robotic army to assist the Lightning Beings in accomplishing their mission. Jason knew he had to stop them, but he also knew he wouldn’t make it without the help of SOPHIA 3rd. Since he couldn’t recover the parts, he decided to redesign &amp; reconstruct it with (assumedly) the help of Eve to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him. After 29 days, SOPHIA was completely rebuilt and ready for battle again, now known as SOPHIA 4th.&#10;&#10;Following the Beings’ footsteps, the group jumped in their new vehicle and headed towards the (presumably) Adirondack Mountains, where their quest began anew. In the end, Jason and company triumphed over the Lightning Beings’ underworld invasion, vanquishing the Lightning being known only as the &quot;Mutant Boss.&quot; SOPHIA 3rd&apos;s parts remained missing.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Bloodshot, known as Battle Frenzy in Germany, is a Sega Mega Drive and Sega Mega-CD game developed by Domark. It is notable for being a 3D first person shooter - one of the few available for the Sega Mega Drive and the only game of this genre for the Sega Mega-CD.&#10;&#10;Bloodshot was only released in Mega Drive cartridge form throughout Europe and Australia. It was exclusive to the Sega Channel in North America where it was called by its German name, Battle Frenzy. It is assumed the game was retitled to make the game sound less violent, though the game does not contain any blood (&quot;Bloodshot&quot; is a code name for the fictional &quot;Battle Frenzy&quot; chip implanted in the player&quot;).&#10;&#10;The Sega Mega-CD version was also exclusive to Europe until 2003, when a North American version under the Battle Frenzy name was released. This version was developed and published by Good Deal Games without the consent of Domark or Acclaim.</Overview>

    <Overview>Blue Almanac (ブルーアルマナック) is a 1991 RPG for the Sega Mega Drive by HOT-B published by Kodansha Research Institute for some reason. While it was only released in Japan, Kodansha was planning on translating the game as Star Odyssey, but the translation was cancelled for unknown reasons. Two prototypes were independently discovered by drx and by Brandon Cobb, head of Super Fighter Team, who subsequently acquired a license to complete the translation from HOT-B successor company Starfish (who like to revisit old properties), with intentions on releasing it on the twentieth anniversary of the original release. Despite his PR claiming that he received an &quot;unofficial license&quot; from Sega to distribute the game, Sega really asked him to remove their copyrights and trademarks, consequently making the translation fully unlicensed (while Blue Almanac is fully licensed).</Overview>

    <Overview>Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.&#10;&#10;Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can&apos;t jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.&#10;&#10;Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak&apos;s back.&#10;&#10;In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot &apos;em up sections taking place underwater – completing these earns bonuses.</Overview>

This is once again courtesy of Afromonkeys (Jack Nolddor and Davidian), who, as usual, have also given us a quality conversion. We had already mentioned Chase, a NES game portage by the same creators, which proved to be a pleasant surprise.

Of course, it is up to our heroine to go on a solo mission, flying in her airbike around the Earth, fighting regular enemies and bosses, and ultimately saving the planet.&#10;&#10;This is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter similar to Space Harrier. The game is viewed from behind-the-character perspective. You can use regular fire attacks or limited super-powerful shots that do big damage.</Overview>

    <Overview>The game follows the tale of Chakan, a warrior who was so confident in his martial arts (especially his unmatched swordsmanship) and gifted abilities in sorcery and alchemy, that he declared even Death couldn&apos;t best him in battle. Of course, Death appeared and challenged Chakan with a proposition. If Chakan could defeat him, he&apos;d be granted eternal life. However, if Chakan was defeated, he&apos;d become Death&apos;s eternal servant. In another side-story, Chakan was so feared by the elders of multiple tribes, they dropped their petty differences and amassed to figure out a way to defeat or contain him, and upon overhearing his boasting, summoned the Grim Reaper themselves, informed the Reaper of his boastings, and contracted him to defeat Chakan.&#10;&#10;The battle raged on for several days, spells and swords clashed, until the ultimate victor was very clear...Chakan. Because he defeated Death eventually, he was granted his &quot;reward&quot;:&#10;&#10;“You are a tactful swordsman, so I will not renege on our wager. I grant you the kiss of eternal life, but, for your arrogance and pride I will temper my gift with this curse. You will be a mere shell of yourself as I strip you of most of your powers. Each nightfall, evils will be shown to you, and the pain of their victims will be your pain. You will never know rest as you wander this world searching to slay the horrors that haunt your sleeping world. You will suffer grievous wounds, but you will not die, and as eternity rolls on, you will crave my touch. Your face will bear my visage, and your eyes will burn with hellfire. But...let it not be said that I am without mercy. There shall be an end to your curse. If all the beasts of the dark are slain, then you may find rest.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chakan will live forever until he destroys the four supernatural evils of the terrestrial plane (Spider-Queen, Mantis, Elkenrod, and Dragonfly King) and the elemental plane (Parasite, Tundra Beast, the Last Dragon and the Leader of the Dragonfly Clan).</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>DJ Boy (DJ???) is a 1989 beat &apos;em up arcade game developed by Kaneko. It was published in Japan by Kaneko and in North America by Sammy.&#10;&#10;DJ Boy, also known as DJ Kid, was designed as a standard side-scrolling beat&apos;em up game partially based on the hip-hop culture of the U.S. cities. What made the game unique at the time was the fact that many of the characters rode around on roller skates rather than walking or running.&#10;&#10;The premise of the home console game: A young man named Donald J. Boy (DJ Boy) is a roller fighter taking part of an ultimate fight-race known as &quot;Rollergame&quot;, taking place in Cigaretch City, located on the outskirts of New York City. Many people were excited to see DJ Boy, but a roller fighter gang known as the Dark Knights want him out of the competition. Their leader, Heavy-Met Tony, calls his gang to kidnap his girlfriend Maria, who also comes into town and defeat DJ Boy. DJ Boy must rescue Maria, defeat the Dark Knights, and win the Rollergame competition in one adventure. The arcade plot tells a different story. Two rollerskaters named Bob &amp; Tom (the two playable characters) were break-dancing to the beat of their boombox, until it got stolen from roller-skater thieves (possibly the Dark Knights), in which they must find and defeat them in order to retrieve what is rightfully theirs.&#10;&#10;DJ Boy skates across various stages and utilizes hand-to-hand combat moves in order to defeat opponents, culminating with a battle with a boss at the end of each level. Along the path, the player also encounters prizes, which then can be used later to purchase Power-ups from a store located at the end of each level (in the home version, the arcade simply tallied these as points). In the console versions of the game, as another game, River City Ransom, the &quot;prizes&quot; consist of coins that are dropped by defeated enemies, or food items like burgers that restore health.</Overview>

    <Overview>The Black Knight has brought misery to the land, and the end way to end this is to enter his haunted house to slay him. You are the brave adventurer taking on this quest through 14 increasingly-tough zones.&#10;&#10;The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.</Overview>

    <Overview>Super Real Darwin is a 1987 arcade shoot-&apos;em-up by Data East. Sega ported it to the Sega Mega Drive and released it in 1990 exclusively in Japan under the name Darwin 4081 (ダーウィン４０８１).&#10;&#10;The game controls like a regular shoot-&apos;em-up: A and C shoot bullets, B drops bombs; there is rapidfire. However, unlike regular shoot-&apos;em-ups where weapons are upgraded through powerups, your ship &quot;evolves&quot; to survive situations and get past obstacles. Evolution occurs with the Evol (small faces with an E on them) and B-Evol (darker Evols). Each pickup adds a new evolution state to the list. After a particular amount of time, one evolution wears off and the next evolution is chosen. The DNA powerup does provide a more permanent weapon upgrade, but will merely just make the existing weapons stronger. You can hold up to nine DNA powerups.</Overview>

In other words, these two cowboys were best of friends and nothing could tear them apart that is, until Jenny came to town. Since her arrival, the two best friends have become bitter rivals, each vying for her attention and affection. When Jenny&apos;s father decides to send her on a trip around the world, Will and Rick decide to race each other to see which one of them will accompany her. Through deserts, icebergs, shark-infested waters, and even ancient ruins these two go head-to-head in the wackiest race you&apos;ve ever seen. In split-screen action, you and your opponent (either the computer or a friend) will have to use fancy footwork and a few tricks to be the first to the finish line and win Jenny&apos;s heart.</Overview>

The player takes the role of a private detective hired by a woman to dig up dirt on her husband. In doing so, he goes to a secret underground mahjong club, where he must defeat young girls to extract information -- and their undergarments.&amp;#x0D;&#10;&amp;#x0D;&#10;The mahjong itself is strictly a recreation of the traditional Chinese board game. However, after each round the player wins, the opponent will remove a part of their clothing, until eventually they are completely nude. After defeating an opponent, they will give you the phone number of the next target that must be interrogated, which doubles as a password. There are six different opponents to play against in total.</Overview>

Another aspect of the license is that the variety of offensive and defensive strategies and formations for player and AI use are pulled from the pages of Coach Vitale&apos;s own playbook.&#10;&#10;The game features a 3/4 pseudo-3D perspective similar to that available on the SNES console in Mode 7. There are 32 college teams to choose from in four conferences, and games are played by official NCAA rules. Available gameplay modes include Single Game, 2-on-2, Slamfest (a simple slam-dunk contest), and Tournament. The AI can take control of defense, and the game can be played without foul rules.</Overview>

Each dino has its own strengths and weaknesses. You guide the dinosaur of your choice through the platform levels of the game. You are equipped with a gun: tons of enemies will attack you from all the sides, so your best bet will be walking with the fire button pressed down. You can shoot to all the directions and also engage in melee combat when the enemy is too close. Each level has a boss enemy waiting for you in the end.

Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy voodoo enemies he&apos;ll encounter throughout his adventure, he&apos;s going to need all the help he can get.&#10;&#10;As previously mentioned, there are two personalities to Maui, and as a result, two different sets of controls. Normal Maui carries a bug gun, which can fire a variety of different insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful lightning and fire bugs. It&apos;s also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast at his enemies.</Overview>

While the basic concept remains the same, the game features all-new graphics, streamlined controls, changes to the tech tree as well as completely new levels.&#10;&#10;As in the original game, the player controls the troops of one of three noble Houses, called by the Emperor to mine the Spice Melange on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. A series of consecutive battles must be won by mining spice, constructing a base and building units to attack the enemy.&#10;&#10;The rather complex menu-based controls of the original game have been replaced by a context-sensitive cursor system, where a unit reacts according to what is below the cursor - either moving to a destination or attacking an enemy unit, for example.</Overview>

The levels, rather than being linear, feature some platform elements, and the enemies in the first levels are no longer bank robbers or hit-men, but soldiers and robots instead.

    <Name>Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land</Name>
    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams. When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.&#10;Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).&#10;&#10;Gameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game&apos;s theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).</Overview>

    <Overview>In the single-player game, the player controls Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice through various side-scrolling levels in an attempt to collect musical notes that somehow went missing whilst he was asleep. Each of the four levels were based on amalgamations of the segments of Fantasia, each one around the elements: water (The Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice, Dance of the Reed Flutes and Arabian Dance), earth (The Rite of Spring), air (Russian Dance, Pastoral Symphony and Dance of the Hours) and fire (Night on Bald Mountain, Toccata and Fugue in D Minor). The player defeats various enemies by jumping on them or by collecting magical bubbles that could be used to shoot at enemies as projectiles. In each level, the player collects a certain number of hidden magical notes in order for the song to play once again.</Overview>

  <game name="Fatal Rewind">
    <Name>Fatal Rewind</Name>
    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free. You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit. Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually. Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time. This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes. A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game. You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</Overview>

    <Overview>This game is an unlicensed Russian port of the Famicom/NES game of the same name. The developer is not credited anywhere in the game, but it&apos;s known that it was published by KDS (Kudos), alongside some other ports of the NES games.&amp;#x0D;&#10;The plot is explained on exactly one screen before the game starts: just like in the Famicom/NES original, Kitty has been kidnapped by the Professor for a ransom, that ransom being Felix&apos;s magic bag. Having no other choice, Felix goes on an adventure to rescue his girlfriend.&amp;#x0D;&#10;Similarly to all of KDS&apos;s NES-to-MD ports, this game features the most basic set of mechanics, enough to resemble Hudson Soft&apos;s version. Likewise, this game has no bosses at all, contains only a handful of levels from the original (in this case, 12) and includes the same playlist with songs of different genres and origins, all played at random.</Overview>

Most of the fighting leads to holds from which massive damage can be inflicted by dropping the opponent or throwing him against the wall. Twelve different fighters have available. Aside from the moves, some are also faster or come with more powerful attacks. The game modes include matches for one or two players and a watch mode to view a computer-computer fight.</Overview>

  <game name="Fix It Felix Jr.">
    <Name>Fix It Felix Jr.</Name>
    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Fix-It Felix, Jr. is a platformer game in the Wreck-It Ralph universe. It takes place in Niceland, where Ralph, Felix, several Nicelanders and Q*Bert characters live.At the beginning of a game, Ralph climbs up a hotel, breaking windows as he goes. It is the player&apos;s job as Felix, to repair each window with his magical hammer, while avoiding bricks that fall off when Ralph punches, and Duck Hunt-inspired ducks that fly horizontally across the screen at random. On some screens, if the player waits long enough, a Nicelander will appear in a window to drop off a pie which Felix can collect for a period of invincibility and other effects depending on the version of the game. As the game progresses, the enemies become more numerous and faster, and there are more windows to repair. What&apos;s more, Ralph will smash and break windows that the player has already repaired, forcing them to go back and fix them. Higher levels introduce rather increasing numbers of randomly-placed obstacles such as purple flowerbeds which prevent Felix from jumping up or down between two windows. The versions made available online also feature open window shutters for blocking Felix horizontally, while the arcade version instead has a number of large piles of bricks fall between two windowsills and get stuck starting in the fifth round. Felix can jump over these brick piles to get across the row, but they will kill him if he steps into them or jumps into them from below. &#10;&#10;The story of the game is that Ralph is destroying Niceland Apartments in retaliation for the Nicelanders bulldozing his hollow-stump home in the forest to build their apartment building and leaving him in the town dump. When Felix fixes every window on the screen, Ralph climbs higher and reveals more floors of broken windows. When Felix fixes the highest screen (with penthouse visible on the arcade version), a cutscene plays where the Nicelanders join Ralph and Felix on the roof and award Felix a medal (which floats down from behind a pair of parting clouds), a pie, and a kiss on the cheek. The Nicelanders then lift up Ralph and hurl him off the building into a mud puddle. Finally, Ralph comes back to try again in a new level.</Overview>

The majority of titles released for the CD32 were essentially the versions developed for Amiga home computers, taking only minor advantage of the CD-ROM medium with extra levels, CD audio, and/or FMV sequences.&#10;&#10;The creators, Erwin Kloibhofer and Henk Nieborg, were also responsible for the games The Adventures of Lomax and Lionheart.</Overview>

    <Overview>Flux is a music visualizer software developed by EXP for the Sega Mega Drive and released by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Europe. When the Mega Drive is connected to a Sega Mega-CD, an audio CD is in the CD tray, and this cartridge in the Mega Drive, Flux will have the Mega CD play the music on the CD and show various user-configurable effects (the default being a two-channel oscilloscope). B pauses playback, Left and Right skip tracks, and Start brings up the configuration panel.&#10;&#10;The cartridge works for two reasons — the Mega CD supports using a cartridge as a boot image (this was also done with Wonder Library) and supports having the boot image access the CD drive for audio playback. Kega Fusion can emulate all this specifically for Flux; instructions are in its readme file. It requires a small modification to its configuration file and a European Mega CD BIOS to work.</Overview>

In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. &#10;&#10;There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, &quot;Arcade&quot; allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas &quot;Grand Prix&quot; only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.</Overview>

The king then summons Bop and Bump to reclaim his stolen possession from Thump.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of flying through six air and water levels: Gadget Bay, Zeppelin Attack, The Lost City, Sub Attack, The Crystal Lake and Thump&apos;s World.

There are also chests littered throughout the stages which contain coins also. These coins can be spent at a shop where the player can purchase upgrades.&#10;&#10;The game also contains bonus stages where the objective is to open all the chests in a limited amount of time.</Overview>

    <Overview>It&apos;s the year 300x. The Earth has been ravaged by careless humans, leaving an uninhabitable, polluted wasteland. The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon. The good guys, the Leezaluth, aren&apos;t happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the Earth before Gulfer gets at it. They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, Leezaluth gives Earth&apos;s last hero, Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system.&#10;&#10;Why don&apos;t the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves? It&apos;s not exactly clear.&#10;&#10;So, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter. The star attraction here is the TOZ system. The TOZ is an orb that follows your ship around, and can be shot at enemy ships to absorb their weapons. Using the TOZ, Dan will fight through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and really large bosses.</Overview>

    <Overview>Granada is a free-roaming scrolling shooter. You control the titular maneuver cepter Granada as you make your way through each stage, destroying the enemy&apos;s weapons. You have a map that tells you where your targets are on the stage, and once all the targets have been destroyed a large boss enemy appears which must also be destroyed. You are equipped with a standard cannon, as well as a more powerful blaster that will actually push your machine backwards with the recoil. There are also assist pickups which will follow you and reflect any shots you fire at it toward the nearest enemies.</Overview>

However, there are weapons that can be found, including grenades, rocket launchers, whips, swords, guns, and shotguns, which you get once an enemy drops them on the ground, so you can use these weapons against them. If you manage to get one of the guns, you can shoot enemies with a limited supply of ammo. Once the ammo runs out, your only option is to pistol-whip them.</Overview>

It is based on either the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan or the 1998 Disney film of the same name — which it steals art from, giving us a potential earliest release date. Some of its music is stolen from another unlicensed game, Chuanpu&apos;s 1996 Ya Se Chuan Shuo; whether or not the rest is also stolen has yet to be determined.&#10;&#10;Interestingly enough, the game has a story screen... in Chinese, English, Spanish, Portugese, and Arabic. The stories appear to be identical: during the Tang Dynasty, the Hun warlord Tan-Yu led his soldiers to seize the dynasty, and Tang conscripts all men to fight the oncoming forces. Hua Mulan, not wanting to see her old father fight, goes in to fight for him.&#10;&#10;The game is a typical platformer. B attacks and C jumps.</Overview>

You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.</Overview>

  <game name="Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho">
    <Name>Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho</Name>
    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams. When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.&#10;Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).&#10;&#10;Gameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game&apos;s theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).</Overview>

He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games.

The Japanese version, titled Shin Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu Hokuto no Ken (新世紀末救世主伝説 北斗の拳?, &quot;New Legend of the End-of-Century Savior: Fist of the North Star&quot;), is based on the manga series Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star in English).

Versions for the Commodore 64 and Amiga based upon Last Battle were developed and released by Elite in Europe in 1991.</Overview>

    <Overview>Mega 6 Vol. 3 is a compilation of Sega Mega Drive/Genesis games released in PAL territories during 1995, and was included as part of the console&apos;s late official bundles. The cartridge was the final release in the series of Mega Games compilations, and contains 6 of Sega&apos;s most successful games from the early days of the Genesis. It is the only volume of the Mega Games 6 series to introduce a new game to the Mega Games range, and the only Mega Games release to use the shortened Mega 6 title. The game came with individual instruction manuals for each game rather than integrating them all into a single manual. This compilation utilises the standard game selection screen seen in previous Sega compilation releases, including the Mega Games series, Classic Collection and Sonic Classics.</Overview>

    <Overview>Megapanel (メガパネル) is a 1990 puzzle game developed and published by Namco (under their Namcot branding) for the Sega Mega Drive. Though initially released only in Japan, the game has made its way to the west through various compilations and consoles with built-in games.&#10;&#10;Megapanel is a sliding puzzle game similar to fifteen-tile puzzle games. The aim is to clear as many panels as possible before the pile reaches the top of the screen. In order to clear panels, three or more panels of the same color must be lined up together either vertically or horizontally. Use the D-pad to slide panels (each button indicates what direction to slide to, so the appropriate panel is automatically chosen) and A to bring the next row up immediately. A new life is awarded every 10000 points.</Overview>

T&amp;E Soft ported the game to the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 along with three other New 3D Golf Simulation games; however, unlike those three ports, this one did receive an international release under T&amp;E&apos;s equivalent True Golf Classics label as Pebble Beach Golf Links.&#10;&#10;It was later brought to the Sega Saturn; in Japan this version was called Pebble Beach Golf Links: Stadler ni Chousen (PEBBLE BEACH GOLF LINKS ～スタドラーに挑戦～). Despite being on a newer system, the game does not take particular advantage of the Saturn&apos;s features and continues to use the same rendering style as the entries on previous-generation machines. It does add an overhauled UI, more fluid player animations, and videos of professional golfer Craig Stadler (hence the Japanese name) giving suggestions before each hole.</Overview>

    <Name>Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom</Name>
    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Phantasy Star III is a sequel to the previous game in the series, Phantasy Star II, although the connections to other games in the Phantasy Star series are not immediately evident. Gameplay is similar to the games before it in the series, with combat still being turn-based and battles randomly occurring. Players must explore both overworld maps and dungeons in order to progress through the game.&#10;&#10;Phantasy Star III mostly follows the traditional roleplaying game formula seen throughout the series, with exploration of several 2-D worlds, character recruitment, and random enemy encounters using a turn-based battle system. Unlike previous games, the series staple of &quot;techniques&quot; play a diminished role in combat, which is ironic considering the role they play in differentiating the game&apos;s two major factions - with techniques being exclusive to Layans, and viewed as &quot;evil magic&quot; by the Orakians.</Overview>

    <Overview>Phantasy Star is a 1987 role-playing game developed and published by Sega. It is the first in a long line of Phantasy Star games, and is often considered one of the best games for the Sega Master System.&#10;&#10;In 1994, Sega released a version for the Sega Mega Drive, Phantasy Star Fukkokuban. This version is merely the Master System version on a Mega Drive cartridge PCB with the appropriate connector pin to signal Master System mode changed accordingly (which is how pass-through devices like the Power Base Converter work). The situation behind this release is unknown; the most prominent rumor is that it was a contest giveaway.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Pirates! is a single-player game. The player receives a letter of marque authorizing service as a privateer for Spain, the Dutch Republic, England, or France in the Caribbean. The player&apos;s loyalties may change over the course of the game; he may also hold rank with multiple countries and may turn to piracy at any time. Gameplay is open-ended; the player may choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members, or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase his wealth through trade. The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. Also, as the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point he is given a position in his future life, from beggar to King&apos;s adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.</Overview>

Exhibition is the basic one team versus another for one game. The tournament mode is divided into two different modes; 8 Nations and World Cup. 8 Nations is just a shorter version of the World Cup tournament mode because it involves only 8 teams instead of all 32 of them like it does in the World Cup mode.</Overview>

    <Overview>Psycho Pinball is a 1994 pinball video game published and developed by Codemasters, released for the Sega Mega Drive in the United Kingdom, and MS-DOS personal computers in the United States and Europe.&#10;&#10;There are four differently themed tables; Wild West (American Old West), Trick or Treat (Halloween), The Abyss (Caribbean underwater), and finally Psycho (an amusement park). While the first three are regular tables, Psycho broke new ground; it is connected to the others by activating certain jumpers, then launching the ball into one of the tents, and the ball continues in the other table, returning to drop from the tent in Psycho when it drains. It is also the only one with a spring ball launcher and no multiball (presumably because of the potential for one of the balls to transition between tables).</Overview>

Though the arcade version of Tant-R reached South Korea, the Mega Drive version remained exclusive to Japan and no versions of the game have ever made it to North America or Europe.&#10;&#10;Tant-R borrows its graphical style from Bonanza Bros., and is therefore often seen as a spin-off. The two were paired with the game&apos;s sequel, Puzzle &amp; Action: Ichidant-R in volume 6 of the Sega Ages 2500 series for the PlayStation 2. Tant-R was also paired with Quiz Syukudai wo Wasuremashita for a compilation on the Sega Saturn. A spinoff Saturn game, Sega Ages Vol.1 Syukudai ga Tant-R, also made.</Overview>

    <Overview>While Donald is flipping through some books in Uncle Scrooge&apos;s library, a treasure map from King Garuzia, the old-time ruler of the Great Duck kingdom, falls out. It leads to the king&apos;s most prized possession. Donald thinks this is his path to riches. Unfortunately Big Bad Pete overhears and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure.&#10;&#10;Donald, using a partial map from the library, travels to a variety of places around the world seeking clues to find the treasure, including Duckburg and Mexico. After defeating Count Dracula in Transylvania, Donald receives a more complete map pointing to the Maharajah in India, Egypt, a haunted Viking ship, and finally the South Pole, where Donald finds an ancient Viking diary said to reveal the location of the treasure. However, upon finding the diary, Pete shows up, holding Donald&apos;s nephews hostage in exchange for the diary. After giving Pete the diary, Donald travels to Pete&apos;s hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back. The diary reveals that the map, when dipped in water, will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure.&#10;&#10;After evading the traps and defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure, Donald enters the treasure vault, only to find a simple stone statue. He is disappointed, but Huey, Dewey and Louie accidentally break the statue, which reveals a golden jeweled necklace was hidden inside. Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together.</Overview>

    <Name>Ranger X</Name>
    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>The player assumes the role of Ranger X, piloting a powered exoskeleton who leads the fight back for his home planet against the invading Rahuna forces. Ranger X is equipped with a jet pack and an assortment of weapons. The jet pack allows for short periods of flight, the duration of which is limited by the jet pack&apos;s temperature. Upon overheating, the player must land and wait for cool down. Alongside Ranger X&apos;s standard pulse rifle, the player has access to various special weapons including a flamethrower and homing attacks. Unlike the pulse rifle, the special weapons drain a power bar, which can only be recharged when Ranger X is in a bright light source. This special arsenal can be increased by collecting power ups scattered across the levels. On certain levels, the player may also control a supporting vehicle - an Ex-Up, such as Indra - a futuristic motorcycle, a premise described as &quot;RoboCop on a Harley&quot;.</Overview>

    <Name>Red Zone</Name>
    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Red Zone is a helicopter action shooter in which you pilot an AH-64B Apache into the heart of enemy territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed dictator. Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.&#10;&#10;The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea. Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series. Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.</Overview>

    <Overview>ResQ is an unreleased Sega Mega Drive developed by Tempest Software and set to be published by Psygnosis. It is a 2D action game with both space ship and on-foot segments. Had it been released, ResQ would have been an exclusive title for the Mega Drive.&#10;&#10;Psygnosis cancelled ResQ very close to release for unknown reasons. It was reportedly programmed on 486 DOS PCs, with the artwork produced with Deluxe Paint II and III on Amiga 1200s. A prototype has since been unearthed, with an internal copyright date of 1993.&#10;&#10;Notably, ResQ&apos;s bonus stages are depicted as third-person on-the-rails shooting segments which involve primitive 3D polyons, similar to the Super Nintendo&apos;s Star Fox.</Overview>

    <Overview>Band together six powerful magicians and search out the fabled Rings of Power to free your world. Interact and trade with inhabitants of thirty cities. Over 100 animated spells to choose from!&#10;&#10;Rings of Power is quite different from traditional console RPGs gameplay-wise, and is more similar to Western-style games such as Ultima series. You can freely wander through the huge isometric world, and are not obliged to follow any storyline except the main quest for the eleven rings. You can talk to NPCs about many topics, choose whom to fight, bribe people, etc. There is a day/night cycle which affects the behavior of characters. Unlike most RPGs, there are no weapons and armor in this game. The turn-based combat is entirely dependent on magic spells. On your journey you will encounter characters from several guilds, each proficient in his own type of magic, and make them join your party.</Overview>

    <Overview>Unusually for Electronic Arts in the early 90s, this was a platform -shooter game with little or no adventuring or strategy elements. The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</Overview>

An evil space pirate, Kaiser Greedy, has made the planets&apos; leaders obey him. The inhabitants of Planet Neer (Flora outside Japan) pray for a hero before Greedy&apos;s mind control snatches them. The desperate prayers reach the nebula of the Star Goddess, Oruto. She awakens one of her children, Ristar, with the sole purpose of granting the wishes of the innocent people. He must stop Greedy and the brainwashed leaders of each world in the galaxy, to restore peace to the galaxy.&#10;&#10;In Mega Drive versions outside Japan, Oruto is not seen. Instead, Ristar has a father figure, the Legendary Hero, who is a shooting star that protects the Valdi System. Rather than Oruto awakening Ristar, the Legendary Hero was kidnapped by Greedy, and it is up to Ristar to rescue his father as well. However, Oruto is still seen in the Game Gear version.</Overview>

Players can continue their game from where they left off, however the player has only one chance to complete the 50th and final rally.

    <Overview>S.S. Lucifer: Man Overboard! is a platform game released for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear in 1994. Originally developed by Zeppelin Games for the Commodore Amiga, it was ported to Sega&apos;s consoles by Odysseus Software and published by Codemasters.

Lucifer. Similar to Lemmings, this requires guiding the passengers to an exit by interacting with the environment. If the player takes too long the room will be flooded.&#10;&#10;Neither the Mega Drive or Game Gear versions of S.S. Lucifer: Man Overboard! were released in North America or Japan. They remained exclusives for Europe and Australia.</Overview>

    <Overview>Sansan (サンサン) is an online service allowing people living in Japan to play the abstract strategy board game Go with other subscribers over the internet on a Windows PC. However, at its launch in 1994, a version for the Sega Mega Drive was also made available. This version of the game allows players who have a Sega Mega Modem to connect over a 33.3kbps or ISDN line to play other members who have a Sansan ID. However, as of 2011, there are no known Mega Drive-compatible Sansan servers. A local two-player version of the game is also included for play.&#10;&#10;For whatever reason, the Mega Drive version did not last very long — it is one of the rarest and most sought-after Mega Drive games; Sega of Japan&apos;s official archive doesn&apos;t list it (despite Sansan Co., Ltd. having T-series code T-147) and a ROM was not dumped until February 2011. The Windows PC version of the service continues to this day.</Overview>

Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don&apos;t count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit&apos;s agility score and a random seed.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Shining Force II is a tactical role-playing game. The player assumes the role of the Shining Force leader, Bowie. When not in combat, the player can explore towns and other locales, talk with people, and set the members and equipment of the army. Some towns have a headquarters where the player can inspect and talk with his allies. While roaming through town or moving throughout the world, one can find both visible and hidden treasures and interact with certain objects.&#10;Each ally unit is represented by a character with a background and personality. Some of these characters are hidden, requiring specific events to occur before they will join the force. Each ally unit also has a class, which defines the abilities for that unit. These abilities range from what type of weapons they can use to what kind of spells they can learn. Units can become stronger by fighting enemies and performing various actions which gives them experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels. Once a unit reaches level 20, that character has the ability to advance to more powerful class through promotion. Some characters have two different classes they may be promoted to, one of which is only accessible using a special hidden item.&#10;Battles take place on a square grid, and each unit occupies a single square. Battle is turn-based. Each turn, a character can move and perform one action: either attack, cast a spell, or use an item. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping an item during the turn, do not count as actions.&#10;The battle is won if all enemies are defeated, or if the enemy commander is defeated. If Bowie is defeated in combat or withdraws, the battle is lost and the player is returned to the nearest town, where he can recover his allies and fight the same battle again.</Overview>

It was rereleased in 1999 with a modified copyright date saying &quot;1999&quot; — this is where the current ROM dump comes from.&#10;&#10;The game is similar to Streets of Rage, going so far in that it borrows voice samples from this game. Some graphics are reportedly stolen from Street Fighter II, and the sound driver is said to be borrowed from Data East, or more specifically, the one used within High Seas Havoc.&#10;&#10;Otherwise it is a completely original game, set in ancient China and follows three selectable characters fighting waves of enemies with swords. Assuming the player has the items to do so, he/she can also perform a variety of special attacks by pressing A, damaging all enemies on screen.&#10;&#10;A future re-release to a primary American audience was announce by Piko Interactive in 2015 as Water Margin: The Tales of Clouds and Winds.</Overview>

Also, after pressing  the select changes and gives the player the possibility to choose a profi character. A Tournament works similar to Pick Up.

The goal is to survive the tournament and beat all rival teams.Slam features a Editor in which you can create your own players. On the first screen you can name your character and change his look. Similar to RPGs you can give 90 points to different abilities, which have influence on how the player will behave in-game. Finally you can choose a hometown for your character to complete it. In case you don&apos;t like the default slam, you can give every custom player own. On the first screen you can select which ranges slam you want to edit and test it.

They fight and Sonic seems to emerge victorious when Knuckles flees from the duel after sensing someone is trying to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles races ahead closely followed by Sonic to find Robotnik trying to steal the Master Emerald: It had been his plan all along to snatch it while Sonic and Knuckles were too busy dealing with each other. Realizing he had been tricked, Knuckles reacts by attacking Robotnik, which fails when Robotnik electrocutes Knuckles. Sonic tries to intervene but Robotnik stills manages to escape. Knuckles now realizes his mistake and that Sonic is in fact on his side. They join forces and teleport to Sky Sanctuary.&#10;At Sky Sanctuary, Knuckles and Sonic watch the Death Egg launching in the background. Knuckles activates a bridge so Sonic can cross over. Sonic defeats a rebuilt Metal Sonic on the way to the Death Egg, and manages to board it before it leaves the atmosphere. Onboard the Death Egg, Sonic defeats Robotnik and destroys the ship once and for all, only for Robotnik to get away with the Master Emerald in one of his giant robots. If Sonic hasn&apos;t collected all seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds, the game ends here, and the ending in which the Master Emerald does not return to Angel Island occurs. After the credits, the player sees a scene with Robotnik still in possession of the Master Emerald.&#10;If all the seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds are collected, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic and chases Robotnik into the Doomsday Zone. After failing to lose him in an asteroid belt, Robotnik&apos;s machine is destroyed, Sonic and Tails return the Master Emerald, and the Floating Island becomes airborne once again. If the player didn&apos;t collect all the Super Emeralds, a scene occurs which shows an Egg Robo emerging from a pile of metal. If all Emeralds are collected, the player sees the Sonic 3 and Knuckles logo featuring Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.</Overview>

    <Overview>Sonic Crackers is an early prototype build of the game Knuckles&apos; Chaotix, incorporating many of the elements that would appear in the final game. Its name comes from a peculiar, and clearly quickly made, ASCII-art title screen. Sonic Crackers is thought to be an engine test, composed of various different game engines, which are swapped out using RAM coding.&#10;&#10;The game features Sonic and Tails, who, in the main demonstration of its link to Knuckles&apos; Chaotix, are held together by rings that they carry and that are joined by an elastic force. Also, Sonic can pick up Tails and throw him upwards, to make it easier to reach higher platforms. The stages and music are also similar to those in Chaotix. There are no sound effects at all during gameplay. There are no badniks to be found, however there are spikes, and you lose rings when hitting them (even though you have none).</Overview>

Because the service is now long defunct, the game was unknown to much of the Sonic community for a time. The game was later released in 2004 on Sega of Japan&apos;s website, and it received more widespread attention as it was noticed by English-speaking Sonic fans this time around.</Overview>

    <Overview>The Sonic The Hedgehog 2 Nick Arcade Prototype, released to the public on Nov. 7, 2006, is a prototype of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, which features extremely unfinished zones. This cart, determined to be near exact to the one shown in two 1992 episodes of Nick Arcade, predates the more famous Simon Wai prototype. It was found and sold to drx in cartridge form for $1500 via a community effort.&#10;&#10;In this version, only one zone can be normally played: Emerald Hill Zone. The rest of the Zones can be played only through a Level Select code. The level select screen is completely identical to the Japanese version of Sonic 1, and even contains the original Green Hill Zone, which is somewhat unplayable because of strange physics (caused by differences in how collision data is handled between Sonic 1 and Sonic 2).</Overview>

    <Overview>Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles is a game that results when Sonic 3 is locked-on to Sonic &amp; Knuckles via Lock-On Technology. It acts as one large combined game and all the levels from Sonic 3 and Sonic &amp; Knuckles become available. &#10;&#10;There are several noticeable differences when playing the games combined. Knuckles is playable in the Sonic 3 levels and Tails becomes available in the Sonic &amp; Knuckles levels. Also, all of the levels from both games are accessible, starting from Sonic 3. Once these levels are completed the Death Egg falls off screen intact instead of being destroyed, and then the play continues straight to the levels of Sonic &amp; Knuckles. The final boss of Sonic 3 is also omitted for Sonic and Tails.&#10;&#10;After collecting all the Chaos Emeralds of Sonic 3 a new quest becomes available when entering the first special Stage in Mushroom Hill Zone which allows you to collect seven new Emeralds called &quot;Super Emeralds&quot;. When these Emeralds are collected, Hidden Palace Zone will become available, and Sonic can transform into Hyper Sonic and Knuckles can transform into Hyper Knuckles. Tails has no Hyper form, but the Super Emeralds are needed for him to transform into Super Tails, as the Chaos Emeralds alone have no effect on him.</Overview>

Sega ported it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1990 — this port was not released outside Japan (the IBM PC port was the only port of the time to be released outside Japan, published by Sierra) and unlike the other Mega Drive Dragon Slayer games, is not a product of the later Sega Falcom partnership.&#10;&#10;In the main series, Sorcerian was followed by Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu. However, as with other main series entries, Sorcerian received a number of its own sequels on Japanese home computers, including the Dreamcast game Sorcerian: Shichisei Mahou no Shito.</Overview>

    <Overview>Squirrel King is an unlicensed platform game developed for the Sega Mega Drive. It was published and developed by Gamtec, and therefore its origin is Taiwan.&#10;&#10;Squirrel King is extremely similar to Capcom&apos;s Chip &apos;N Dale: Rescue Rangers and it sequel, Chip &apos;N Dale: Rescue Rangers 2 for the NES, to the point where the player actually plays as two characters named &quot;Chip&quot; and &quot;Dale&quot; (though they look slightly different to their Disney counterparts). C jumps, B picks up and throws crates, and A allows Chip or Dale to throw fireballs, assuming they have some in their inventory.&#10;&#10;Squirrel King is the basis for another unlicensed title, Super Mario World, also for the Mega Drive,but developed by Chuanpu and possibly published by Ming Super Chip Electronic.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Starflight is a space exploration, trading, and combat video game developed by Binary Systems and published by Electronic Arts in 1986. Originally developed for IBM compatible and Tandy systems, it was later released for the Amiga, Atari ST, Macintosh and Commodore 64. A fully revamped version of the game was developed for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991.&#10;&#10;Set in the year 4620, the game puts players in the role of a starship captain sent to explore the galaxy. There is no set path, allowing players to switch freely between mining, ship-to-ship combat, and alien diplomacy. The broader plot of the game emerges slowly, as the player discovers that an ancient race of beings is causing stars to flare and destroy all living creatures.&#10;&#10;The game has been widely praised by both contemporary and modern critics, and is one of the earliest instances of a sandbox game. It led to the development of a sequel, Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula, and influenced the design of numerous other games for decades after its release.</Overview>

    <Overview>Steel Empire (originally released as Koutetsu Teikoku in Japan, and otherwise known in various English materials as The Steel Empire or Empire of Steel), is a side-scrolling shoot &apos;em up video game released on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive home consoles in 1992, and was later ported to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2004.&#10;&#10;Steel Empire is notable amongst shoot &apos;em up games for its unique aesthetic designs. Mostly low-tech in nature, with it being set in the late-19th century of an alternate world, the game&apos;s aircraft, weaponry, powerups, environments, enemies and bosses are heavily stylized adding strong steampunk elements to the style, themes and visuals of the game. Steam power, propeller-based aircraft, biplanes, dirigibles and heavily-armored steam trains with giant cannons play large roles in the game&apos;s protagonists and opponents.</Overview>

Sega ported it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1989, putting in a new soundtrack supposedly composed by Tokuhiko Uwabo. Not only was it never released outside Japan, but it does not fully implement TMSS, meaning it will only work on early Model 1 Mega Drives. The Mega Drive would receive a sequel, Advanced Daisenryaku, which not only does work on all Mega Drives, but also contained Mega Modem support.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Super Hydlide (originally entitled Hydlide 3: The Space Memories) is the third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply &quot;bumping&quot; into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player&apos;s morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game&apos;s most decisive battles.</Overview>

The Mega Drive version was released exclusively in Europe in 1995.&#10;&#10;Very similar to Micro Machines, the game was distributed on a J-Cart, allowing a further two controllers to be attached to the Mega Drive console. The basic aim is the same as Micro Machines, in that the player drives numerous different types of cars around a track, however it is presented in an isometric perspective and allows up to six cars to race at once rather than just four.&#10;&#10;The game is also notable for being one of the few Mega Drive games to have a four-player split screen mode rendered in real-time.</Overview>

    <Overview>As in its predecessor, the player takes control of an helicopter which is used to attack a group of guerrillas. The helicopter itself uses guns and missiles, and can also air brake. A distinctive feature that also appears in the arcade game is the use of different viewpoints during the entire game; during normal gameplay and when fighting sub-bosses, the game utilizes a third-person perspective from behind the helicopter, similar to Space Harrier, but the camera changes to a top-down perspective when fighting bosses. Super Thunder Blade had four stages of play.</Overview>

    <Overview>Sword of Vermilion is about the son of Erik, king of Excalabria, who takes on a quest of revenge to defeat Tsarkon and free the world of Vermilion from evil.&#10;In the town of Excalabria the people went about their business, and tended to the fields. One day, vicious fighting broke out everywhere as the army from Cartahena, led by the wizard-king Tsarkon, swarmed all over the town. The townsmen were overwhelmed, and the castle of King Erik V collapsed. Erik V summoned his bravest, strongest and most faithful warrior, Blade, and gave him his infant son and an ancient family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom. Erik ordered Blade to save himself and the child while the castle burned. Blade traveled to a small village named Wyclif, where he settled down and raised the child as his own son. Eighteen years later, the son of Erik begins his quest.&#10;The quest consists of travelling to towns and villages, battling creatures to gain experience and finding items such as swords, shields and armour, as well as many other items such as Herbs and Candles. Boss monsters take the form of larger, stronger creatures which are integral to the story. Fighting Boss Monsters takes place on a side on view of the battle where magic cannot be used.&#10;The titular Sword of Vermilion is the most powerful weapon at the end of the game.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Tecmo Cup Football Game is a 1992 game for the NES by Tecmo. This was the European name; in America it was called Tecmo Cup Soccer Game. In Japan where the game originated, it was called Captain Tsubasa and was based around the media franchise of the same name. As such, rather than being a straight soccer simulation, Tecmo Cup Football Game takes a more cinematic/RPG-esque approach to the sport, with the actual game being presented cinematicly and moves made by choosing from menus in a limited time.&#10;&#10;A version under the European name was being programmed for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993; only Sega and Tecmo are listed as involved companies and the programming appears to be unique to this game. The game was not released in any region; the reason why is unknown. A prototype ROM can be found in many ROM sites; it is usually called Tecmo Cup, is listed as being from Japan, and is listed as a bad dump (presumably because the header was hacked out of Twinkle Tale, which does have in common with this game one thing: using the MC68000&apos;s line 1111 emulator trap to do common routines, though the actual routines are different). Because the westernized game is still similar to Captain Tsubasa in many ways, it is often pirated by Asian pirates as a genuine Captain Tsubasa game</Overview>

    <Name>Teddy Boy Blues</Name>
    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Teddy Boy Blues (テディボーイブルース) is a 1985 game for the Sega System 1 by Sega. The game was endorsed by Japanese singer Yohko Ishino, whose song of the same name was both the source of its title and the music in the background. (Consequently, the game is incorrectly known as Teddy Boy Blues: Yohko Ishino to many English speakers.)&#10;&#10;In this game, you play as a kid who must destroy boxes from which enemies come out. You have two buttons: one to shoot your gun with and one to jump with. Shots from your gun may be used to &quot;destroy&quot; enemies (they become items that can be collected for points), destroy barricades (which are always blue), and (with enough hits) destroy the boxes, which resemble dice counting down the number of hits needed to destroy them. Once all the enemies and boxes are destroyed, the level is complete.&#10;&#10;A port to the SG-1000 Mark III was released in Japan as a launch title for the console (along with Hang-On). It was subsequently released overseas on the Sega Master System, renamed Teddy Boy, which is the same except that the main theme song was changed due to licensing issues. TecToy also released an alternate version only in Brazil called Geraldinho, featuring an edited main character based on the titular protagonist of the popular comic strip. A port to the Sega Mega Drive was released in 1991 exclusively in Japan on the Sega Game Toshokan service. A port to the Sega Mega-CD as part of SING!! Sega Game Music presented by B.B. Queens was also released.</Overview>

    <Overview>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.&#10;&#10;Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You&apos;re not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await.&#10;&#10;The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.</Overview>

Buster must go through several levels, including a volcano, an undersea adventure, a pirate ship, and a forest, among many other levels. However, many of his foes are out to stop him, including Roderick Rat and Gene Splicer, who has brainwashed several of Buster&apos;s friends, including Plucky Duck, Dizzy Devil and Hamton J Pig. Upon defeating Gene, the helmet used to control Buster&apos;s friends will fall off and explode, leaving them slightly confused about what has happened to them, or simply to fall down in a comical fashion, as in the case of Calamity Coyote.&#10;&#10;To complete each level, Buster must find Gogo Dodo, who will allow him to jump through a portal. Additionally, Buster can find portals reminiscent of the show&apos;s rainbow-coloured logo, that will take Buster into Wackyland. Here, Buster must attempt to collect as many items as he can before touching one of the numerous Dodos that populate the level.</Overview>

    <Name>Triple Score: 3 Games In 1</Name>
    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Triple Score: 3 Games in 1 collects three previously released games in one cartridge: Super Hang-On (1989), World Championship Soccer (1989) and Columns (1990).&amp;#x0D;&#10;&amp;#x0D;&#10;The sequel to Hang-On for the arcade and for the Master System (Sega&apos;s 8-bit platform), Super Hang-On is a motorcycle racing game that takes you across Africa, Asia, America and Europe. Each course has multiple stages. To advance, you must reach various checkpoints within the allotted time limits. Your score increases as you race on-track. If you veer off-track or have a collision, your score will temporarily stop increasing.&amp;#x0D;&#10;&amp;#x0D;&#10;In addition to the aforementioned Arcade Mode, Super Hang-On features a special Original Mode exclusive to the Genesis. This mode of play features a different circuit and more options. With the money you&apos;ll earn from winning or placing in races, you can hire a mechanic and buy better parts (such as mufflers, brakes and frames) to upgrade your bike.&amp;#x0D;&#10;&amp;#x0D;&#10;The next game on the cartridge, World Championship Soccer, features 24 international teams battling for a spot in the Final Tournament. Each team is ranked according to skill from one to five. Individual players are rated according to speed, kicking strength, tackling strength and accuracy. When selecting a team, you must choose 11 starters from a roster of 16.&amp;#x0D;&#10;&amp;#x0D;&#10;If you don&apos;t want to enter the tournament, you can play a special one or two-player Test Match, which consists of a single game of soccer. If a game ends in a tie, the winner will be determined by a series of penalty kicks. The penalty kick screen puts you behind the kicker while the rest of the action in World Championship Soccer features an overhead view.&amp;#x0D;&#10;&amp;#x0D;&#10;Last but not least is Columns, a Tetris-like game that takes you out of the world of sports and into the ancient land of Phoenicia. Originated among the Phoenician merchants, Columns has you arranging columns of rainbow-colored jewels (three jewels per column) that drop one by one from the top of the playfield. Your objective is to line up like-colored jewels horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in order to make the jewels in that row disappear. If the columns pile up to the top of the playfield, the game will end.&amp;#x0D;&#10;&amp;#x0D;&#10;In addition to the standard game of Columns, you can play Flash Columns in which you must make a flashing jewel disappear before time runs out. Also, two players can play Doubles (alternating on one field of play) or split-screen mode (two separate games going at once).</Overview>

Instead of bombs you can call helper planes. These planes make a formation around you and help to shoot all enemies.&#10;&#10;Along the way you get the chance to collect power-ups by shooting transport trucks. When these are destroyed they release a power-up. There are three types. First is the weapon upgrade, with this you get a wider and more powerful shot. Second, you get more calls for helper planes. And third are extra lives.</Overview>

    <Overview>First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final &apos;Mother of All Battles&apos; has its own surprises. &#10;&#10;Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.</Overview>

    <Overview>Uchuu Senkan Gomora (宇宙戦艦ゴモラ), is a shoot-em-up by UPL, originally released in 1990 for the arcade, and then ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. While the arcade version was released overseas (in the US under license from American Sammy under the name Bio-Ship Paladin), the MD version was only released in Japan — however an American title screen is present in the ROM and displayable if the region is set to US, which may mean a US release was planned (this is unconfirmed). It is UPL&apos;s only Mega Drive game — they would go bankrupt shortly after publishing it (the later Task Force Harrier EX was ported and published by Treco).&#10;&#10;A shoots your weapons; the laser weapon from your main ship can be charged by holding A. B allows you to take control of a beam shot. While B is held down, the D-pad will move a box-shaped target on the screen and A will shoot beam shots toward the target. C is listed as &quot;PAD MODE&quot; but does not appear to do anything. In each level, you can get orbs which give you either subships that shoot weapons diagonally or certain powerups (such as an automatically moving beam target or doubling the size of your ship).&#10;&#10;Pressing Start at the title screen gives you a configuration menu where you can, among other things, choose to play one of two 2-player modes. Normal 2-player mode is 2-player cooperative (two ships on screen at once), while another option allows the second player to take control of the beam laser while you take control of the main ship.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Vampire Killer, known as Akumajō Dracula in Japan, is a platform-adventure game produced by Konami and released in 1986 for the MSX2 computer platform in Japan, Europe, and Brazil. In contrast to the more traditional platform gameplay of the NES Castlevania, the MSX Vampire Killer was instead a more open-ended platform game. The game&apos;s non-linear design had a similar structure to Metroid released that same year. The game laid the foundations for the open-ended action-adventure platform gameplay later seen in the 1987 title Castlevania II: Simon&apos;s Quest, 1997 title Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and most 2D Castlevania games following it.&#10;It was in development around the same time as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game Castlevania, which shares the same title in Japan. The MSX2 version of Akumajō Dracula was released in Japan on October 30, 1986, a month following the NES version, making it the second game in the Castlevania series. It was the first Castlevania game released in Europe. It was never released in North America.</Overview>

One day, however, the armed forces of the prosperous planet Syracuse have turned on its people for no apparent reason, and it is up to you and the Verytex fighter to stop them and find out why.&#10;&#10;A shoots (you have rapidfire). B drops bombs (you have a limited supply, but you can get up to 6 by collecting items with the letter B on them). C changes the speed of the ship (there are three available speeds, the current speed is shown in the HUD), and the charge generated at the back of your ship can be used to destroy close-by enemies.&#10;&#10;Powerups are collected as usual. There are three weapons available (each identified by a different color): the default &quot;yellow&quot; weapon that shoots normal bullets, the &quot;blue&quot; weapon that shoots boomerang-shaped bullets which are weak but very spread, and the &quot;red&quot; weapon that shoots a very powerful concentrated laser but only can shoot forwards. Collecting the same kind of weapon the ship currently has will level up it.&#10;&#10;Two more power-ups are available: one with the letter &quot;M&quot; that makes the ship shoot missiles alongside the current weapon (up to 7 at any given time on screen) and one with the letter &quot;S&quot; with gives the player a shield that can last several hits.</Overview>

    <Overview>Virtua Fighter 2 VS Tekken 2 is a pirated game based off Fighters Megamix and Tekken, made for the Mega Drive by an unknown company. Despite the name, this game includes 5 Virtua Fighter 2 characters, 5 Tekken characters and 2 Fighting Vipers characters: Akira, Pai, Wolf, Lion, Shun, Heihachi, Jun, Lee, Paul, Kazuya, Honey and Bahn. The control is poorly designed and the engine is similar to some other games like Tekken 3 Special. The player can only punch and kick, move slowly and jumpkick if the button is pressed at the perfect time. As a result, the game is more difficult than it should be, although in the options the health bars can be modified so that one or both of the players can&apos;t take any damage, making it impossible for the opponent to win.</Overview>

The game consists of racing Formula-1-looking cars around a beginner, intermediate, or expert track, competing against a second player or computer drivers. Despite having Formula-1 cars, the game controls are very &quot;arcadey&quot; and players can see the leap they made from here to Daytona.&#10;&#10;The Megadrive/Genesis version of Virtua Racing is of note as it is the only game for the system which features the SVP chip (Sega Virtua Processor). The chip is a 3D processor built into each cartridge (the console itself had no 3D capability) and is very similar to the SNES&apos;s SuperFX chips, used in games such as Starfox and Stunt Race FX.</Overview>

    <Overview>An Olympiad game simulating common winter game competitions - the Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge, 2-men Bobsled, Ski Jump, Cross Country, Biathlon and Speed Skating.&#10;&#10;The game features a basic 3D engine which allows to simulate slopes with ease, which enhances the gameplay of some events such as the Downhill. Gameplay, as expected from a Winter sports game, relies on finding the faster trajectories in most events (Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge and Bobsled), pacing the run correctly (Cross Country and Biathlon), skill and timing (Ski Jump), with button mashing reserved for just one (speed skating). The player (up to ten) can select his (or her) competitor face and nationality from one of 16 possible choices, and by selecting different difficulty settings, different computer controlled athletes take part in the competition along the player.</Overview>

The time limit can also be extended by picking up a glowing orange orb which appears during the last ten seconds of the counter, adding thirty seconds to it.</Overview>

    <Name>World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck</Name>
    <ReleaseYear />
    <Overview>Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are sucked into a magical world, while preparing for a magic act. Now they must survive over a dozen different side-scrolling levels, in order to return home.&#10;&#10;Mickey and Donald can run, jump, or attack by flourishing their capes. Enemies defeated in this way turn into doves, cards, or other harmless objects depending on the enemy. After defeating the boss of each level, a new magic spell is learned, allowing the pair to traverse the next level; i.e. flying on a magic carpet or going underwater in an air bubble. This was one of the few Genesis games to feature voice samples.&#10;The gameplay changes depending on if the player selects Mickey or Donald, in a one player mode, or if two people want to control both characters at once. For instance, Mickey can squeeze through certain gaps, while Donald must find a different route; if both are playing, Mickey can pull Donald through the gap. Either can stand on the others&apos; shoulders to ascend higher, and lower a rope to pull the other up.</Overview>

    <Overview>The game takes place in the Danger Room, a training area for the X-Men inside the X-Mansion. A virus transmitted via satellite has infected the Danger Room, disabling control and safety limits. The X-Men must endure the unpredictable behavior of the Danger Room until the virus can be located and eliminated. Once the virus is eliminated, the X-Men discover that Magneto is behind the computer virus and the final stage involves a battle with him.&#10;Gambit, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, and Cyclops are available to play. Each character can jump and use various unlimited weapons (i.e. punch, kick) and a superpower which had a usefulness limited by a mutant power bar similar to a life meter, making the player rely more on standard attacks. The mutant power bar would slowly regenerate when depleted and when switching characters in mid-game, would revert to the status of the next characters mutant power bar from the last use (characters yet to be used would start off with a standard full bar of mutant power).</Overview>
