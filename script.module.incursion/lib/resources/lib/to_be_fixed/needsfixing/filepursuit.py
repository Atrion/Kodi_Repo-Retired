    This has been put in the needs fixing folder as the owner of Filepursuit
    has contacted me and advised that his server is unable to handle the
    amount of requests he has been receiving. In respect I have pulled the
    source from Incursion regardless to the fact that the cloudflare security
    could be circumvented.
